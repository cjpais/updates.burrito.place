This project originated from a desire to express myself more fully and share with less effort. A desire to stay more in the present.

The project and it's specific idea keeps shifting and changing through time as I learn and experiment. Recently I've realized that part of expression and sharing means that it involves other people too. Duh. So I want to invite you in on the journey. This is my first attempt at expressing some of the ideas behind what's being built.

## The `burrito`

At the core of it all is building a little playground. Let's call this playground a `burrito`. Anyone can have their own `burrito`.

Your `burrito` contains any kind of data you may have or produce. This data might be voice notes, email, calendar, spotify listening history, messages, etc.

Imagine that ChatGPT could answer questions about any of the data in the `burrito`. That's the idea. Some questions might be:

- "how many times did I surf this week?"
- "how much money did i spend this week?"
- "who is my top artist on spotify"
- "how long have i listened to alice longyu gao this week"
- "what impact did Lex's podcast have on me this week?"
- "what did I enjoy most today"
- "where have I gone climbing this year? what have I climbed?"

It's no fun to do this in isolation though. I want to also be able to get answer to questions that are much more social and may involve reaching out to other people's `burritos`. Maybe they look like:

- "when is Chandler available to watch a movie?"
- "who is thinking about local large language models in my network?"
- "who in san diego loves alice longyu gao?"
- "let Uncle Tim know when I'm an hour away from him"
- "what would be a good movie to watch with kyle"

Now we are talking. What's cool to me, is that if enough people have a `burrito` I can start to build an algorithmic feed that I control, with things I want in it. Not things to grab my attention but things that I care about. I could also give that control over to the `burrito` if I wanted, but that's a choice we get in [burrito.place](https://burrito.place).

_What about privacy? Anyone can just look into my data?_

No absolutely not. I believe it should be entirely in your control how you allow your data to be queried. I definitely don't want my entire life in public. I think this is a top priority for the `burrito`

Also none of this is to mention, it should be easy for the `burrito` to send your messages on it's own. Being proactive about things, maybe like "you haven't talked to austin in a week, maybe give him a call and see what's up."

## In Summary

The core idea is that an experimental platform for data can enable all kinds of unlocks for us. I think it will take a lot of experimentation and play to find out what is best for you. I want to play around and see what works for me.

I want to be able to express a bunch of the experiences or joys I'm having in life, but I don't want to spam you with them either. I also want to be reminded of these myself. I want to ideally use a technology like the `burrito` to find and talk to more interesting people. People who I share commonality with, or those who have a different opinion than me. I wanna hear em out.

I am also very curious how something like the `burrito` serves as a backend for characters like [Tanaki](https://lingonberry.ai/tanaki). Perhaps Tanaki has their own `burrito`. Perhaps Tanaki is one of the ways I interact with my `burrito`.
